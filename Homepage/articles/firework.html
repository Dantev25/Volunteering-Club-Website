                    <p>
                        As festive season is approaching at a very rapid pace, everyone from children 
                        to our elderly family members are very eager and already in the mood for celebrations. 
                        Many of us, as our well-known end of year tradition follows, have already been buying 
                        firecrackers to make our celebrations more special. However, did you know that these fireworks 
                        have quite a few negative and harmful consequences?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First and foremost, these little bright colored objects cause massive air pollution in a very short amount of time, 
                        leaving very harmful substances in the air for several days. They also lead to many accidents whereby most of 
                        the time children or even adults can get severely injured. Not to forget about how exploding many firecrackers 
                        can lead to serious health problems like asthma and bronchitis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another aspect that many people forget about during this time of festivities is how their pets are going to react 
                        to the firecrackers. Many animals get very scared and disturbed during the heavy blasting a lot of lost pet cases 
                        are reported annually following the welcoming of the New year.

                        Hence, Eco warrior club encourages all pet owners to take care of their pets and to keep them safely inside during the 
                        festive season.
